# **Launch Roulette: Crypto Platform Edition**

**Game Brief (North Star Document)**

## 1. What This Is

**Launch Roulette** is a short, shared-screen, decision-based game designed to celebrate the December launch of SoFi’s crypto platform (buy / sell / hold + crypto deposits). It turns real launch tradeoffs into fast, absurd, and collaborative scenarios that teams resolve together in breakout rooms.

This is not a video game in the traditional sense.
It is a **facilitated experience** supported by a lightweight web interface.

---

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of Launch Roulette is to:

* Celebrate the complexity and success of the crypto platform launch
* Create shared laughter around real tradeoffs, blockers, and constraints
* Reinforce cross-functional empathy (product, eng, risk, ops, design, etc.)
* Deliver a memorable, low-pressure team moment

This is **not** a retrospective, postmortem, or technical review.

---

## 3. Target Experience

* **Duration:** 25–35 minutes total
* **Format:** One host sharing screen + breakout rooms
* **Group Size:** Works for ~10–60 people
* **Energy:** Fast-paced, playful, lightly chaotic, but safe
* **Outcome:** “That was hilarious and weirdly accurate”

---

## 4. How It’s Played (High Level)

1. Host spins a wheel on a shared screen.
2. A scenario is revealed (inspired by real launch decisions).
3. Participants break into small groups for ~60–90 seconds.
4. Each group decides on a response (A/B/C/D).
5. Host reveals the outcome and updates shared “meters.”
6. Repeat for several rounds, with occasional surprise twists.

No individual inputs, logins, or accounts.
All interaction is verbal + host-controlled.

## 5. Tone & Style Rules

**Tone**

* Wacky, absurd, and self-aware
* Satirical, but never mean or embarrassing
* “Laughing with,” not “laughing at”

**Language**

* Plainspoken, modern, slightly unhinged
* Short sentences
* Punchy outcomes
* Avoid jargon overload unless used for humor

**Boundaries**

* No sensitive or confidential information
* No naming individuals unless explicitly approved
* No blame framing (“who messed up”)
* No real metrics or post-launch performance claims

---

## 6. What This Is NOT

To protect scope and velocity, this experience explicitly excludes:

* ❌ Backend services or persistence
* ❌ User accounts or authentication
* ❌ Multiplayer synchronization
* ❌ Real-time voting or chat
* ❌ Mobile-first optimization
* ❌ Competitive scoring or “winners”
* ❌ Detailed technical simulations
* ❌ QA, bug tracking, or edge-case handling

If it’s not essential to the shared experience, it’s out.

---

## 7. Success Criteria

Launch Roulette is successful if:

* The game runs start-to-finish without crashing
* Everyone understands what’s happening within the first round
* Participants are actively discussing in breakout rooms
* At least a few people say “oh god, I remember this”
* The room ends energized, not drained

---

## 8. Design Philosophy (for Builders)

* **Lo-fi execution, high-fidelity intent**
* Optimize for clarity over cleverness
* Prefer scripted outcomes over emergent behavior
* Facilitation > mechanics
* If something is ambiguous, choose the option that keeps the game moving

---

## 9. Ownership & Constraints

* **Owner:** [You]
* **Delivery Mode:** Static frontend (SPA)
* **Hosting:** Any zero-config static host
* **Build Philosophy:** One file or minimal file set; easy to reset; easy to explain

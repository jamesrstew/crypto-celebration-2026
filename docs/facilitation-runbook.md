# **Launch Roulette**

## **Facilitation Runbook (Host Playbook)**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This runbook tells the host **exactly how to run Launch Roulette live**.

It answers:

* How to set up the room
* How to pace the game
* What to say (and when)
* How to use surprise mechanics effectively
* What to do if things go sideways

This document assumes:

* One primary host
* Optional co-host / producer
* A live audience on Zoom (or similar) with breakout rooms

---

## 2. Pre-Game Setup (10 minutes before)

### Technical Checklist

* Screen sharing works (browser tab, not entire desktop)
* Audio is clear
* Breakout rooms can be created quickly
* Chat is enabled
* App is loaded and reset to Splash Screen

### Host Prep

* Read Game Brief once (especially tone rules)
* Skim Content Bible (no need to memorize)
* Decide in advance:

  * How many rounds you’ll play (recommended: 8–10)
  * Whether Fast Follow Tokens are enabled
  * Whether you’ll use Catastrophes (recommended: yes, sparingly)

### Backup Plan (Important)

If the app breaks:

* Have a Google Slides version ready
* Or run verbally using screen-shared scenarios
  The experience should continue even without the UI.

---

## 3. Opening Script (2 minutes)

Suggested host language (paraphrase, don’t read verbatim):

> “This is **Launch Roulette**.
> We’re going to relive the crypto platform launch—emotionally, not technically.
> You’ll get scenarios, make decisions in small groups, and then suffer the consequences together.
> There are no right answers.
> If this feels familiar, that’s the point.”

Rules to state clearly:

* This is for fun
* No real metrics or blame
* Fast decisions > perfect decisions

Then click **Start Game**.

---

## 4. Breakout Room Structure

### Room Size

* Ideal: 3–5 people per room
* Avoid solo rooms

### Instructions to Participants

Before the first breakout, say:

> “In your room, read the scenario, argue briefly, and pick one option.
> You don’t need consensus—just a decision.”

Optional:

* Ask each room to nominate a spokesperson
* Or have them drop their choice in chat when back

---

## 5. Standard Round Timing

**Target per round: 3–4 minutes**

1. **Spin Wheel** – 5–10s
2. **Read Scenario Aloud** – 15–20s
3. **Breakout Rooms** – 60–90s
4. **Collect Decisions** – 15–20s
5. **Lock Choice** – 5s
6. **Reveal Outcome** – 15–20s
7. **React / Laugh / Move On** – 10s

Momentum matters more than discussion depth.

---

## 6. How to Collect Decisions

Choose one method and stick with it:

* Chat: each room posts “Room X: B”
* Verbal roll-up: call on 2–3 rooms
* Majority vote (quick hands)
* Host picks based on loudest energy (allowed!)

Important:
**Do not litigate the decision.** Lock it and move on.

---

## 7. Using Surprise Mechanics (Critical)

### Slide Deck Drop

Use **1–2 times max**.

Best moments:

* When the room feels confident
* When a “reasonable” choice just won
* Mid-game, not first or last round

Host script:

> “Quick update. A slide just dropped.
> This changes the framing.”

Reveal constraint. Force re-decision quickly.

---

### Fast Follow Tokens

Use to:

* Let the room dodge pain
* Create future tension

Remind them:

> “Fast follow means *not now*, not *never*.”

At end of game, do a **Fast Follow Audit**:

* Count how many deferrals occurred
* Read a humorous consequence summary

---

### Catastrophes

Use **only when triggered** (meter hits zero).

Don’t overdramatize. Treat it as:

> “Yep. That tracks.”

Catastrophes are narrative spice, not punishment.

---

## 8. Host Tone Guidelines

Do:

* Read outcomes with confidence
* Lean into punchlines
* Keep things moving
* Laugh at the absurdity

Avoid:

* Over-explaining
* Defending outcomes
* Letting one person dominate
* Turning it into a real debate

If energy dips:

* Shorten breakout time
* Skip optional mechanics
* Jump straight to outcome

---

## 9. Mid-Game Adjustments

If the game is running long:

* Reduce breakout time to 45s
* Skip Slide Deck Drops
* End after next round

If energy is high:

* Add one extra round
* Use a surprise mechanic
* Ask one breakout to explain their reasoning (briefly)

---

## 10. Ending the Game (2–3 minutes)

When rounds are done or time is up:

* Read final meter states aloud
* Summarize the “launch story” they created
* Call out shared themes (tradeoffs, compromises, resilience)

Suggested closer:

> “This launched because a lot of smart people made imperfect decisions under pressure—and kept going.”

Thank the team.
Optionally segue into:

* Real celebration
* Shoutouts
* Drinks / food / swag

---

## 11. Post-Game Reset

* Click **Reset Game**
* Close screen share
* Do **not** try to replay immediately (energy drops fast)

---

## 12. Final Notes

* The host matters more than the UI
* Clarity beats cleverness
* Short, punchy rounds > exhaustive content
* End while people still want more
